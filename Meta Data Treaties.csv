The Convention is composed of 10 Chapters and 28 articles.The objective of the Convention is to ensure the optimal management of fishery resources so as to: (i) promote the development of categories operating directly or indirectly in the commercial fisheries sector; (ii) permit a balanced development of recreational fishery activities; (iii) contribute towards the protection and enhancement of the aquatic environment. The Convention establishes an Italo-Swiss Commission for Fisheries, in which each State has a commissioner and two vice-commissioners. There is also a subcommission which is made up of fishery and hydrobiology experts from both States.The commissions terms of reference are essentially: (i) to prepare and submit proposals for any amendment to the Convention that might arise; (ii) to settle differences in interpretation and application of the Convention. In addition, the commissioners are responsible for: (i) monitoring the uniform implementation of the Convention and the provisions estasblished for its execution; (ii) submitting necessary recommendations to the appropriate authorities of each State. Chapter 2 of the Convention establishes that each state retains its jurisdiction over the issue of fishing licences and stipulates the publication of a joint list of authorized fishing gear.Chapter 3 deals with the terms and conditions of fishery prohibition. It specifies the prohibited fishing techniques and zones, and the areas in which the use of certain fishing gear is forbidden. Chapter 4 prescribes the fishery restrictions by establishing: (i) a minimum catch size for certain species; (ii) closed seasons for certain species; (iii) the obligation to return unauthorized fish to the water.Chapter 5, headed \'Derogations\', envisages two noteworthy provisions. On the one hand, each commissioner is explicitly authorized, subject to his counterpart being duly notified, to introduce measures in his territory that are more restrictive than those prescribed in the Convention. On the other hand, the measures foreseen in chapters 2, 3, and 4 may be provisionally waived for technical or scientific reasons. Such an amendment, however, must be jointly agreed to by the commissioners and must in no case run contrary to the aims of the Convention. Chapter 6 deals with environmental protection and specifies: (i) prohibited intervention and/or works, and those requiring authorization; (ii) obligations regarding fish stocking operations. Chapter 7 concerns the exchange of information and urges both States to promote scientific research.Chapter 8 fixes the principles of surveillance and the applicable penalties thereto. Control and surveillance is left to the national officers of the contracting parties which are competent only for the part of the lake under their State\'s jurisdiction. However in case of flagrante delicto the officers are authorized to act in waters under the other State\'s jurisdiction, but that does not entail the right to consfiscate the fishing material nor the right to undertake an arrest. Chapter 9 provides for mandatory consultation between the commissioners and their joint decision on any matter related to the implementation of the Convention. It should also be noted that each State bears the cost of its delegation and experts."

Where he avails himself from such a right, the owner of a ship is to constitute a fund to be distributed among the claimants in proportion to the amounts of their established claims. The owner of a ship registered in a State Party and carrying more than 2,000 tons of oil in bulk as cargo is to maintain insurance to cover his liability under the Convention (art. VII). Contracting States agree not to permit a ship under its flag to trade unless a certificate attesting that such insurance is in force has been issued.

Summary of provisions: Article 1 defines environmentally harmful activities and specifies that the Convention applies only insofar as environmentally harmful activities are not regulated by a special agreement between two or more Contracting Parties. Any person who is affected, or may be affected, by a nuisance caused by environmentally harmful activities in another Contracting State has the right to bring before a Court or Administrative Authority of that State the question of permissibility of such activities including measures to prevent and compensate damages.  He or she also has the right to appeal the decision of that body to the same extent and on the same terms as a legal entity of the State in which the activities are being carried out (art. 3). Moreover, each State undertakes to appoint a supervisory authority to safeguard general environmental interests regarding nuisance arising out of environmentally harmful activities in another Contracting State.  That authority has the right to institute proceedings before the competent court or administrative authority of another Contracting State regarding the permissibility of the environmentally harmful activities under the condition that such an authority in the other State can do the same (art. 4). The supervisory authority may publish communications from the examining authority in the local newspaper or in some other suitable manner and may institute investigations of the effects in its own State (art.7). If necessary in determining the damage caused in another State by environmentally harmful activities, the supervisory authority of the other State undertakes to make arrangements for on-site inspection (art. 10).  Where the permissibility of environmentally harmful activities is examined by the Government or an appropriate Minister, consultations are to take place between the States concerned (art. 11).
